#  Introduction to RESTful API

1. **JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation**:  
   - JSON is derived from JavaScript and is used for structuring data in a readable format. Although it originates from JavaScript, it is now widely used across different programming languages.

2. **JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format**:  
   - JSON is designed to be easy to read and write for humans, as well as easy for machines to parse and generate. Its lightweight nature makes it a popular choice for data exchange over the web.

3. **JSON is used to send data between computers**:  
   - It is commonly used in web APIs for transmitting data between a client (like a web browser) and a server.

4. **JSON is a text format**:  
   - JSON data is represented as plain text, making it easily accessible and compatible with various systems and applications.

5. **Used for storing and transporting data**:  
   - JSON can be used to store data in files or databases and is also utilized for data transmission in network requests (like HTTP requests).

6. **JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand**:  
   - The structure of JSON is straightforward, using key-value pairs and arrays, which helps convey data meaning intuitively.

7. **JSON is language independent**:  
   - While it originates from JavaScript, JSON can be used with many programming languages, including Python, Ruby, Java, C#, and others, making it a versatile choice for data interchange.

### Example of JSON

Here's a simple example of a JSON object:

```json
{
  "name": "Ayoub",
  "age": 25,
  "isStudent": false,
  "courses": ["JavaScript", "Python", "Django"],
  "address": {
    "street": "123 Main St",
    "city": "Anytown",
    "country": "Country"
  }
}
```
